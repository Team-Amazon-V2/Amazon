## Initial Setup

Fork and clone this repo to your local directory

Start by running `npm install` in the CLI inside the main directory

After all packages are installed in the main directory, that is it for initial steps.

**Moment of truth!** enter `npm start` in the command line where the application should be served using PORT 3007

Enjoy!
